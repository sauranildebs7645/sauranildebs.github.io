			<b>Robust EMRAN based Neural Aided Learning Controller for Autonomous Vehicles</b>
			<br><br>

			<p>Designed an online evolving neural network-based inverse dynamics learning controller for an autonomous vehicle's longitudinal and lateral control under model uncertainties and disturbances. The inverse dynamics of the vehicle are approximated using a feedback error learning mechanism that utilizes a dynamic Radial Basis Function neural network, referred to as the Extended Minimal Resource Allocating Network (EMRAN). EMRAN uses an extended Kalman filter approach for learning and a growing/pruning condition helps in keeping the number of hidden neurons minimum. The online learning algorithm helps in handling the uncertainties and dynamic variations and also the unknown disturbances on the road. The proposed control architecture employs two coupled conventional controllers aided by the EMRAN inverse dynamics controller. The control architecture has a conventional PID controller for longitudinal cruise control and a Stanley controller for lateral path-tracking. Performances of both the longitudinal and lateral controllers are compared with existing control methods and the simulation results clearly indicate that the proposed control scheme handles the disturbances and parametric uncertainties better, and also provides better tracking performance in autonomous vehicles.</p>

			<b>Improving Multi-UAV Coalition Capability through Performance Modeling</b>

      <a>J.G. Manathara</a>,
			<b>Sauranil Debarshi</b>,
			<a>P.B. Sujit</a>
			<br><br>
			<p>Developed an online performance modeling technique that estimates the capability of a UAV to
perform a task within a coalition, and show that this estimate converges to the true capability. Simulation results
demonstrate that forming coalitions using the proposed performance model improves mission time and reduces the
number of deployed resources.</p>

			<b>ROSNet: A WMN based Framework using UAVs and Ground Nodes for Disaster Management</b>

			<br><br>
			<p>Developed a prototype system to establish communication (using wireless mesh network - WMN) through the use of stationary and mobile ground nodes, and aerial nodes using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This network is ad hoc and establishes connectivity without the use of a cellular network or internet. Our system provides a complete end to end architecture, where we deploy an android application on smart phones at the user-end, the ad hoc network comprising of stationary and mobile nodes, and a graphical user interface (GUI) at the base station that shows situational awareness.</p>

			<br><br>
			<p>Proposed a system wherein we explore on-board re-identification  of  persons  using  cameras  mounted on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).  The camera images are dynamically shared between multiple UAVs by virtue of wireless mesh networking, also making use of the Robot Operating System (ROS) for on-ground control of the UAVs from a control station, facilitating the exchange of images between them.</p>
